/* JOIN

- JOIN queries can be used for a variety of purposes, such as converting data found in two or more tables into information.

-- INNER JOIN

-- In LEFT JOIN queries, the result will not only show the rows that are common in both tables, associated through the Primary 
-- and Foreign Keys, but also the non-associated data from the table on the left side of the relationship. In other words, 
-- regardless of whether the Foreign Key has a NULL value or not, all records from the table on the left side of the relationship

/* Important Observations

Which table is on the Right and which table is on the Left?

- Left ðŸ¡¢ Table that has the Foreign Key;
- Right ðŸ¡¢ Table that does not have the Foreign Key.

The Table that does not have the Foreign Key (tb_categories), is the Table that controls the relationship, because if a category is deleted, the existence of the products in this category no longer makes sense. Example: If the Grocery Store decided to no longer sell fruits, it does not make sense to delete the fruits category and keep all the products in the fruits category in the Database.
